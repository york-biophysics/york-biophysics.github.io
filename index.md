# Single-molecular cellular biophysics

The Leake research group of Biophysics and Biological Physics is jointly
hosted by the [Physics](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/) 
and [Biology](https://www.york.ac.uk/biology/) Departments at the 
[University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/) and
comprises research themes of both experimental biophysics and theoretical
biophysics tools, as well the use of biophysics science tools and techniques
to address questions in the life sciences and develop bionanotechnology tools
for application in biomedicine, synthetic biology and bioengineering. We focus
at a precision of single biological molecules but using cutting-edge
biophysics tools and concepts to enable us to explore emergent properties in
living cells and tissues.  Prof Leake coordinates the ~50 researchers in the
Physics of Life Group as well as running his own team focused of
single-molecule biological questions addressed using home built technology.

These include  a wide range of home-built light microscopy instruments
including total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy,
single-molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET), variable-angle
epifluorescence/HILO, optical tweezers and magnetic tweezers, and rapid
millisecond single-molecule imaging using Slimfield. These are all integrated
with advanced control software that we write ourselves, and synchronised
microfluidics that we build ourselves. It is so much more rewarding to actually
construct the instruments with our own hands to really cater them to overcome
technological limitations that then lead to really new insights into biology.

We are an enthusiastic, interdisciplinary biophysics team and interface closely
with Physics of Life Group in the Department of Physics, and the University
of Yorkâ€™s Biological Physical Sciences Interdisciplinary network (BPSInet) and
through a range of cross-departmental collaborations between physical and life
scientists
