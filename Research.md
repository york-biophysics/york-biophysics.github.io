Our core expertise involves bespoke microscope design and ultrasensitive
imaging technologies in biophysics. These have led to insight into how
biological reactions progress in real time. Early work in biophysics included
optical tweezers instrumentation to probe mechanical properties of muscle (1),
interferometric imaging approaches for the study of flagellar motors in
action(2) and single-molecule fluorescence imaging of membrane proteins in
bacteria (3). We have developed single-molecule biophysics tools to dissect the
architecture of bacterial DNA replication machinery resulting in the first
observation of three DNA polymerases at replication forks instead of the
historically accepted two(4). Development of these tools have resulted in
direct observation of the mechanisms of structural maintenance of chromosome
(SMC) proteins, required for chromosome processing in all organisms (5).
Current biophysics projects focus on single-molecule fluorescence probing of
DNA-protein machines in cells, biofilms and tissues, and new tools of
magneto-optical tweezers with super-resolution imaging(6,7). Emerging
biophysics investigations involve DNA repair and recombination, bacterial
sporulation, super-resolution imaging of photosynthesis molecular machine
factories, cancer biology mechanisms through probing the EGF receptor pathway
using live cell single-molecule imaging of carcinoma cells, bacterial and
eukaryotic cell division mechanisms, mechanisms of controlling and exploring
DNA topology, and probing gene regulation using rapid single-molecule tracking
of transcription factors in live cells (8) and turnover of replication
machinery (9), and membrane trafficking. In short, we have an enormous array of
single-molecule tools at our disposal (10,11) which are either ready and
available to us, or which we can build and develop to help tackle a suite of
very fundamental, unresolved biological questions

In addition, we have been part of multiple recent large EU consortia, such as
[SynCrop](https://syncrop.org) employing 15 Early Stage Researchers scientists across a range of
scientific disciplines and bringing together 16 expert academic and industrial
partners across Europe targeted at using state-of-the-art synthetic biology
tools for improving food and pharmaceutical production, importantly involving
cutting-edge biophysics to enable characterization of the sub-cellular
physiological of individual cells and how this changes during conditions of
stress.

We are a core component of the 
[Physics of Life Group](https://www.york.ac.uk/physics-engineering-technology/research/physics-of-life/) 
coordinated by Mark Leake
comprising several research teams in in the University of York Physics
Department, in a highly constructive and collegiate way and drive the
Biophysics and Biological Physics Project seminar series in York, which is a
networking vehicle running 4-6 times each term. This has catalyzed some very
lively biophysics discussions, allows junior members in particular to find
their voice and provides focused project talks as well as talks from experts
from other departments. We are also a core component of the BPSI, a network of
exceptional interdisciplinary science researchers working at the cutting-edge
interface between the life and physical sciences.

The Leake biophysics group in York works on some very diverse biological
systems with a strategic view to seeing their paradigm features as  being
exemplars of longstanding questions, as opposed to our simply focusing on more
incremental types research. We are very much exploratory driven.  It's
interesting, exciting and innovative.

Above all, it's a lot of fun, with an ambitious and innovative
biophysics team. If you are interested in knowing more with a view to
